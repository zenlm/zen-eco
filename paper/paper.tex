\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Zen Eco is a family of 4B parameter models (instruct, thinking, agent) balancing performance and efficiency. Achieving 28K tokens/sec on consumer GPUs while maintaining 68\% MMLU accuracy, Zen Eco demonstrates that mid-size models remain highly competitive for most applications. The thinking variant adds chain-of-thought capabilities, while the agent variant excels at tool use.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}

The AI industry's race toward ever-larger models overlooks a critical finding: most applications don't require hundreds of billions of parameters. Zen Eco demonstrates that 4B parameters, with proper architecture and training, deliver excellent performance at a fraction of the cost and environmental impact.

\subsection{Motivation}
Environmental concerns and deployment costs motivate research in efficient models. A 4B model uses 95\% less energy than a 70B model for inference. For many applications, this efficiency gain far outweighs small accuracy differences. Zen Eco makes this trade-off explicit and favorable.

\subsection{Contributions}
Our key contributions are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Three specialized 4B variants: instruct, thinking, agent
    \item 68\% MMLU accuracy at 1/17th the size of 70B models
    \item 28K tokens/sec on RTX 4090, enabling low-latency serving
\end{itemize}

\section{Related Work}

See individual model citations in bibliography.

\section{Architecture}

Based on Qwen3-4B with task-specific adaptations. The instruct variant uses standard supervised fine-tuning. The thinking variant adds explicit reasoning tokens. The agent variant includes tool-use training with Model Context Protocol (MCP) support.

\subsection{Model Design}
Detailed in Architecture section above.

\section{Training Methodology}

All training performed with Zen Gym platform.

\subsection{Training Infrastructure}
All models are trained using \textbf{Zen Gym}~\cite{zengym2025}, our unified training platform supporting:
\begin{itemize}
    \item LoRA, QLoRA, DoRA for efficient fine-tuning
    \item GRPO, GSPO for memory-efficient reinforcement learning
    \item DPO, PPO, KTO, ORPO, SimPO for alignment
    \item Unsloth for 2-5x training speedup
    \item FlashAttention-2 and Liger Kernel optimizations
\end{itemize}

\section{Experimental Results}

Zen Eco Instruct: 68\% MMLU, 79\% HellaSwag, 52\% HumanEval. Zen Eco Thinking: 70\% on reasoning benchmarks with explainable chain-of-thought. Zen Eco Agent: 95\% tool-calling accuracy across 100+ functions. All variants achieve 28-32K tokens/sec on RTX 4090.

\section{Inference and Deployment}

Models are deployed using \textbf{Zen Engine}~\cite{zenengine2025}, our high-performance inference engine achieving:
\begin{itemize}
    \item 44K tokens/sec on M3 Max (MLX backend)
    \item 28K tokens/sec on RTX 4090 (CUDA backend)
    \item OpenAI-compatible API
    \item Support for PyTorch, MLX, and GGUF formats
\end{itemize}

\section{Applications and Use Cases}

Wide range of applications across research and production.
