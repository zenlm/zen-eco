   - Status: ✅ Uploaded with 2 safetensor shards

### Quantized Versions
5. **zenlm/zen-eco-4b-agent-mlx** - 2.1GB
   - URL: https://huggingface.co/zenlm/zen-eco-4b-agent-mlx
   - Format: MLX quantized (4.501 bits per weight)
   - Status: ✅ Successfully uploaded

6. **zenlm/zen-eco-4b-agent-gguf** - 7.5GB
   - URL: https://huggingface.co/zenlm/zen-eco-4b-agent-gguf
   - Format: GGUF F16 only
   - Status: ✅ Successfully uploaded (F16 only)
   - Note: Q4_K_M, Q5_K_M, Q8_0 quantizations failed due to NaN issues

## ⚠️ Known Issues

### Training Issues
- Models show NaN gradients during generation
- MLX version generates repetitive tokens (!!!!)
- GGUF quantizations (Q4_K_M, Q5_K_M, Q8_0) fail with "found nan value at block 0"
- Only F16 GGUF conversion succeeded

### Test Results
- PyTorch model: RuntimeError with NaN/inf in probability tensor
- MLX model: Generates but outputs repetitive exclamation marks
- GGUF: F16 created successfully but smaller quantizations failed

## Repository Status
- Location: `/Users/z/work/zen/zen-eco/`
- Git: Not initialized (per user preference)
- Structure: Clean, no symlinks
- Tests: All 22 pytest tests pass for local files

## Files Created
- `upload_agent.py` - Direct upload script
- `upload_quantized.py` - MLX/GGUF upload script
- `convert_agent_mlx_gguf.py` - Conversion script
- `test_download_model.py` - Download test script
- `test_mlx_model.py` - MLX test script
- `upload_gguf_simple.py` - GGUF upload script

## Next Steps Recommended
1. Investigate and fix NaN issues in training pipeline
2. Re-train models with proper gradient clipping
3. Test with different learning rates or optimizers
4. Consider using bf16 instead of fp16 for training stability

## Summary
All 6 models (4 base + 2 quantized versions) are now available on HuggingFace and downloadable. However, the models exhibit training issues that affect generation quality. The upload pipeline and infrastructure are complete and working.
